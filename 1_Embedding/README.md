## Embedding folder

This folder contains scripts to embed the input data generated and stored in the `0_Data_Inputs` folder. If you have not yet investigated this initial folder, please do so before proceeding.

We offer scripts to run two embedding strategies:
- **Diffusion Maps:** nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, with scripts located in the `DM` folder
- **Principal Component Analysis:** linear dimensionality reduction methods, with scripts located in the `PCA` folder

Either one can be run independently of the other; it is not essential to run both for subsequent steps in this repository.
