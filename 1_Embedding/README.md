# README: 
## Embedding folder

This folder contains scripts to perform manifold embedding using the input data in the `0_Data_Inputs` folder. If you have not yet investigated this initial folder and its descriptions, please do so before proceeding.

We offer scripts to run two embedding strategies:
- **Diffusion Maps:** nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, with scripts located in the `DM` folder
- **Principal Component Analysis:** linear dimensionality reduction methods, with scripts located in the `PCA` folder

Either one can be run independently of the other, or both can be run to compare their characteristics. However, it is only essential to run one for subsequent steps in this repository.
